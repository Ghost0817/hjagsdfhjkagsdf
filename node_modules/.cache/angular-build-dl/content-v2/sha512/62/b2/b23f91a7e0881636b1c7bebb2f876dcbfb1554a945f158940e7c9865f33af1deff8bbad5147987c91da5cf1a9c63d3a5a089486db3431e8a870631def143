If you are and you happen to be in high school, you may be thinking that your ability at a given sport could end up putting you in line for a sports scholarship that will pay for your college education either in its entirety or, at the very least, partially. However, there is more to getting a scholarship than just being good at sports. One thing you have to keep in mind is that, with sports scholarships, there are a number of ways to obtain them. For some athletes, especially within the more high-profile sports of football and basketball, there is a good chance of being recruited. Not all scholarships that are sports-related come from athletes being recruited, however. In many cases, if you are looking for a sports scholarship for the sport you happen to play, you may have to call recruiters and ask. It is possible that your talents at a given sport are far above most people; however, with so many excellent high school athletes out there, there is still the possibility of being overlooked. There are too many athletes and only a limited number of coaches and recruits, comparatively speaking. In some cases, you will have to contact a coach yourself and offer them your statistics on the field, as well as your academic data as well. Nevertheless, if you have the abilities, the drive, the talent and, of course, the grades, you will eventually find a sports scholarship that fits your needs. The truth is, there are plenty of sports scholarships to go around. Some may be full scholarships while others may be partial; be wise and don't get too far ahead of yourself by only going after full scholarships as your only option. While they do exist, they are not easy to obtain and, when it comes to paying for college nowadays, any help is more than welcome... or at least, it should be.\",\"intro\":\"\",\"new_key\":null,\"screen_type\":\"standard\",\"dictation_type\":\"words\",\"display_order\":0},{\"lesson_screen_id\":115856,\"lesson_id\":385,\"title\":\"Mountain Biking\",\"content\":\"The sport of mountain biking is one of the best active sports you can partake in for a number of fitness reasons. Depending on what style of mountain biking you enjoy, it can also be a great deal of fun while keeping you fit at the same time. People are usually unaware of how many muscles they use when riding a mountain bike and how quickly they burn calories; it can be an extremely good workout for the body. If you plan on riding cross-country along different types of trails, riding a bike can be quite a task. If you're riding over long distances up and down hills it can be very tiring for the legs and lower back. So if you are just starting to ride bikes for the first time, please don't just jump on the bike and go for a 20-mile ride as it may do you more harm than good. One recommendation is to begin by going on short rides of only a couple of miles, which take no time at all, in order to get your fitness training up to a higher level before embarking on longer rides. All the major athletes in the sport will tell you that training is important and you should take part in mountain bike fitness training whenever an opportunity arises. One of the greatest benefits of riding a mountain bike on a regular basis is that bike riding engages some of the largest muscles in the body which, in turn, burns off fat quickly. This will, of course, help you to lose weight and the more you ride your bike, the more weight you will lose. When you ride your bike on flat ground at a slower speed, you will still burn a great number of calories due to the fact that you will be able to continue pedaling for longer periods. This is also perfect for people who don't have the stamina for highly-intensive rides at different speeds and climbs.\",\"intro\":\"\",\"new_key\":null,\"screen_type\":\"standard\",\"dictation_type\":\"words\",\"display_order\":1},{\"lesson_screen_id\":115857,\"lesson_id\":385,\"title\":\"They're Minerals, Marie!\",\"content\":\"Sedimentary rocks are formed at the surface of the Earth, either in water or on land. They are layered accumulations of sediments, fragments of rocks, minerals, or animal or plant material. If a layer of sediment is buried beneath overlying rock, the layer becomes compacted and may form a layer of sedimentary rock. The sediment becomes cemented together by minerals and chemicals or is held together by electrical attraction. Sand and gravel deposits on beaches or in river bars look like the sandstone and conglomerate they may become. Compacted and dried mud flats harden into shale. Mud and shells settling on sea floors can cement into limestone. Sedimentary rocks are important sources of natural resources like coal, fossil fuels, drinking water or ores. Fire is a chemical reaction between fuel and oxygen. Heat is necessary to ignite the reaction. Once a fire has been started, it creates enough heat as a byproduct to keep igniting new fuels. In nature, fuels can be preheated by the sun. This can make them more likely to ignite, either by human error, as with a dropped cigarette or unattended campfire, or by lightning. Fuels themselves are abundant, especially in forests that have not burned in recent years. Oxygen is readily available in the air we breathe. It has about 21% oxygen in it. The positive effects of fire include stimulating growth and maintaining various ecological systems. The negative effects include water contamination, soil erosion, atmospheric pollution and hazard to human and animal life. An earthquake is the result of a sudden release of energy in the Earth's crust producing seismic waves. Earthquakes occur most often along geological faults. They are measured using observations from seismometers. Magnitude 3 or lower earthquakes are mostly undetectable and magnitude 7 or greater can cause serious damage over large areas, depending on their depth. The shallower an earthquake, the more damage to structures it causes. At the Earth's surface, earthquakes manifest themselves by shaking and sometimes displacing the ground. When the epicenter of a large earthquake is located offshore, the seabed may be displaced sufficiently to cause a tsunami. Earthquakes can also trigger landslides and volcanic activity.\",\"intro\":\"\",\"new_key\":null,\"screen_type\":\"standard\",\"dictation_type\":\"words\",\"display_order\":2},{\"lesson_screen_id\":115858,\"lesson_id\":385,\"title\":\"Hypno Toad\",\"content\":\"Tiny poison dart frogs may be only one inch long but they pack a powerful punch of poison. Weighing less than an ounce, these frogs are considered one of Earth's most toxic species. For example, the golden poison dart frog has enough poison to kill 20,000 mice. With a range of bright colors, yellows, oranges, reds, greens, and blues, they aren't just big show-offs, either. Those colorful designs tell potential predators, \\\"I'm toxic; don't eat me.\\\" Scientists believe that poison dart frogs get their toxicity from some of the insects they eat. The insects feed on plants that have toxins, which they then pass on to the frogs who fed on them. Poison dart frogs raised in captivity aren't toxic because the insects they are fed haven't eaten poisonous plants. How do poison dart frogs capture their prey? With a long, sticky tongue that darts out and zaps the unsuspecting bug! The frogs eat many kinds of small insects, including fruit flies, ants, and tiny beetles, which are the ones scientists think may be responsible for the frogs' toxicity. Poison dart frogs live in the rain forests of Central and South America and breed during the rainy season. To attract a female, the male frog calls from a leaf, making buzzing or trilling sounds. After he's attracted a mate and she lays her eggs, the male sticks around to make sure the eggs stay moist until they hatch. Once the little ones hatch as tiny tadpoles, they wiggle on to the male's back. He carries them to a pool of water where the tadpoles wiggle off and complete their metamorphosis into fully-formed frogs.\",\"intro\":\"\",\"new_key\":null,\"screen_type\":\"standard\",\"dictation_type\":\"words\",\"display_order\":3},{\"lesson_screen_id\":115862,\"lesson_id\":385,\"title\":\"Titanic Lessons\",\"content\":\"In 1912, Titanic is the largest artificial moving object in the world.

Slowly, the ship begins to swing away. It looks like the ship might miss the iceberg after all. Then comes a grinding sound. Under the water, the iceberg is much wider than it looks. Titanic scrapes against it. The iceberg has slashed holes in the side of one of the furnace rooms. As water gushes through the holes, it nearly sweeps the crewmen off their feet. Within minutes, the cold, swirling seawater is up to their waists. Seawater is also gushing through holes torn into other sections of the ship. Titanic's hull has 16 sections. Doors can seal off each section if they are damaged. The officer on the bridge orders all the doors closed. He hopes this will prevent disaster. He doesn't know that it's already too late.

The risk of health issues accompanying obesity among children provokes many fears that unless parents and children make significant changes in the lifestyles practiced by our kids, diabetes, heart disease, and other weight-related conditions have the potential to run rampant among American youth. Although encouraging a healthy lifestyle among children, including physical activity and fitness is vital to addressing issues associated with health problems and obesity; the addition of kid's fitness can also promote a lifelong love. Fitness not only encourages physical activity, keeping weight and accompanying conditions at bay, it also helps protect children from injuries that can occur when they are not accustomed to physical activity, movement, and sports. Most injuries that plague children completing physical activities occur as a result of a lifestyle that lacks movement and activity that can provide balance, coordination, and muscle memory necessary for a fit lifestyle. Despite statistics praising physical activity among children as a weight management tool and method of decreasing injuries during activities and sports, fitness among children boasts a plethora of positive results and side effects. Strong bones and joints, stress relief, self-confidence improvement, and better academic concentration are just some of the other benefits touted by a child's active lifestyle. Understanding what types of activities and scheduling conflicts are preventing a child from obtaining a sufficient amount of physical activity and fitness can be a good way for parents to begin to understand how and where transformations can be made regarding kids' health. Tracking the amount of activity a child partakes in can be as simple as gaining an awareness of their school schedules and whether they include physical education classes, recess, and other ways children participate in fitness-centered activities. Children who participate in a variety of physically demanding activities at school, such as extracurricular athletics or PE classes, may not need as much prompting and extra fitness added to their day as a child who spends more time still and sedentary. One of the best ways parents, caregivers, and teachers can prompt children to compete in fitness activities and grasp a healthy lifestyle is by striving toward adopting a similar lifestyle that promotes and values physical activity themselves. Children with even one obese parent have a 50 percent chance of being obese themselves. Children with two obese parents have an 80 percent chance of following in their footsteps. Children who observe healthy lifestyles in their parents and role models have a better chance of adopting similar habits, highlighting the vital role parents play in influencing the fitness levels and physical activity of children.\",\"intro\":\"\",\"new_key\":null,\"screen_type\":\"standard\",\"dictation_type\":\"words\",\"display_order\":5},{\"lesson_screen_id\":115863,\"lesson_id\":385,\"title\":\"Iceland\",\"content\":\"Hike through one of Iceland's many ancient lava fields.

In more acidic waters, Elkhorn coral is less successful at reproducing.\",\"intro\":\"\",\"new_key\":null,\"screen_type\":\"standard\",\"dictation_type\":\"words\",\"display_order\":35},{\"lesson_screen_id\":405886,\"lesson_id\":385,\"title\":\"Music to Tame Animals\",\"content\":\"Can music tame the wild beast? Can it hush puppies and calm kittens? A veterinarian thinks so. The vet has put music in over one thousand animal shelters and says it calms dogs and cats. Moreover, it even cuts down on barking. The vet started the nonprofit rescue animal project nearly four years ago. She asked artists around the world to donate dog-and-cat-friendly music. The result was an MP3 player packed with thirty hours of classics. The classics include music by Beethoven, Mozart, and Chopin. There were nursery rhymes like Three Blind Mice, as well as harps, pianos, and violins copying the sound of ocean waves and gentle breezes. These are given free to animal shelters.
