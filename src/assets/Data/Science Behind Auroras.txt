Science Behind Auroras
Auroras are caused by the sun. The sun sends out a stream of electrically-charged particles called the solar wind. The solar wind travels from the sun toward the Earth at great speed. The Earth is a huge magnet surrounded by a magnetic field. The Earth's magnetic field forces the charged particles in the solar wind toward the planet's northern and southern polar regions. The particles move downward through the Earth's upper atmosphere. As they do, they crash into atoms and molecules of gases such as oxygen and nitrogen. These collisions cause the atoms and molecules to give off light. This light is an aurora. An aurora's colors are determined by the different gases that give off the light.
