Stressful Food
The more uncomfortable you start to feel, the more stress starts to come on. Choose less salty snacks, like low-salt pretzels or even a low-salt version of your favorite potato chip. Junk food, in general, is considered stress-inducing and poor in nutritional components. When your body doesn't get enough of the minerals and nutrients it requires, its chances of being able to handle stress are greatly lowered. Eat yourself into a healthy state instead of toward a stressful one. Watch what you eat and stress will become more of a minor annoyance rather than a pending catastrophe in your life!
