Gecko Eyes
A gecko can see colors in the dark, which few living creatures can do. A nocturnal gecko's eye structure is different from that of other lizards. Most vertebrates have two kinds of cells in their eyes that sense light. These are called rods and cones. Rods pick up only black and white. Cones detect colors, but only when there's lots of light. Lizards do not have rods, only cones. Geckos that come out at night have three kinds of super-sized cones. These cones give nocturnal geckos their super-color vision. It's important for a gecko to protect its eyesight. Most geckos have no eyelids and cannot blink. If dust gets in a gecko's eyes, it uses its tongue to lick them clean.
