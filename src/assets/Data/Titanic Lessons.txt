Titanic Lessons
In 1912, Titanic is the largest artificial moving object in the world. She is as long as four city blocks and wider than a four-lane highway. Some people say she is unsinkable. No expense has been spared to build her. She is grand in every way. Many wealthy and important people are aboard to experience the one-of-a-kind voyage. Tonight, the water is calm and looks as smooth as glass. Yet, there may be danger. Suddenly, something is seen ahead. It looks dark against the starry sky. It's big and it's close. Iceberg right ahead! Titanic travels ever nearer to the iceberg. Slowly, the ship begins to swing away. It looks like the ship might miss the iceberg after all. Then comes a grinding sound. Under the water, the iceberg is much wider than it looks. Titanic scrapes against it. The iceberg has slashed holes in the side of one of the furnace rooms. As water gushes through the holes, it nearly sweeps the crewmen off their feet. Within minutes, the cold, swirling seawater is up to their waists. Seawater is also gushing through holes torn into other sections of the ship. Titanic's hull has 16 sections. Doors can seal off each section if they are damaged. The officer on the bridge orders all the doors closed. He hopes this will prevent disaster. He doesn't know that it's already too late. The doors slow, but cannot stop, the water because the walls don't reach the ceiling. As seawater fills each section, the water spills over the wall into the next section. The first five sections soon fill with water.
