Hero Shrew
At only a few inches long and with no distinctive external features to speak of, the Hero Shrew is seemingly an unremarkable creature. That is, until you accidentally step on one. You see, the Hero Shrew can comfortably survive being stood on by a typical adult human without any injury. The secret to this skill lies in the Shrew's skeletal system or, more specifically, its spine. Unlike almost every other mammal on Earth, with one notable exception which we'll get to in a moment, the Hero Shrew's spine features intricate interlocking vertebrae, a very large number of spinal processes, and is incredibly thick relative to the size of its total body weight.
