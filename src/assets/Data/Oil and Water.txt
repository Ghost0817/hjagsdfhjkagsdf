Oil and Water
Oil and water don't mix. You have probably heard this old saying. It isn't just folk wisdom, however. It's chemistry. Another common expression, "like water off of a duck's back," illustrates the same basic principle. The oil on a duck's feathers repels water and prevents the bird from getting soaked in the rain. Naturally oily feathers also help keep a bird dry as it swims. Chemistry is just one way to repel water in nature. Structure, or the shape of things, is another. To excel at water repellency, the lotus leaf relies on both. Unlike water lilies, the lotus holds its leaves and flowers high above a pond's surface. Still, each lotus is amply prepared to fend off a drenching. The waxy surface of the leaves helps repel water chemically.
