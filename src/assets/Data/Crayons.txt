Crayons
The crayon is a drawing implement made of clay, chalk, plumbago, dry color, and wax. There are two types of crayon: the coloring crayon and the chalk crayon. The coloring crayon, or wax crayon, is the one used by children in making pictures. It consists of waxes such as paraffin, beeswax, and carnauba wax and dry color. Some synthetic waxlike materials are also used in the modern crayon. The waxes are melted and the dry color added with continuous mixing until thoroughly dispersed. Normally, the crayon is entirely consumed during the marking process through abrasion.
