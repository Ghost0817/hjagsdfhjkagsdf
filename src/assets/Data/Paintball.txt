Paintball
Splat! What just hit me? Where did it come from? Welcome to the world of paintball! You were just hit (or marked) by a small round colorful object, about 0.68 inches in diameter, called a paintball. This is the size of your basic paintball. A basic paintball is filled with a water-soluble dye encapsulated in gelatin and comes in nice bright colors or in eco-friendly basic green. Put this little round colorful ball in a device called a marker and you have the beginnings of an experience you will never forget. The game of paintball!
