Putting Out a Flame
Why does blowing on a flame make it go out? There could be a few different reasons. Your breath has a lot of carbon dioxide. When you blow on a flame, the carbon dioxide pushes oxygen out of the way and the flame goes out. Your breath blows away some of the hot air around the flame. If the liquid wax cools down enough, it can't turn into a gas. Without wax gas, the flame won't burn. Your breath blows some of the wax gas away. Without this fuel, the flame will go out. Why does a flame have different colors? The colors of a flame are caused by bits of wax molecules that didn't get completely reacted. These glow a particular color when they reach a certain temperature. Since different parts of the flame have different temperatures, these bits of wax molecules make those areas of the flame glow with different colors.
