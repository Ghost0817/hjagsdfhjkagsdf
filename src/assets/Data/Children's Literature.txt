Children's Literature
Books written especially for children are called children's literature. Children's literature includes stories, fairy tales, fables, poems, and novels. It also includes nonfiction works of history, science, and other subjects. Children's literature can come in the form of picture books or chapter books. Picture books usually have a smaller amount of text, or words, and pictures on every page. They are written for younger readers. Chapter books have few or no pictures and much more text, which is divided into sections called chapters. Chapter books are written for older children.
