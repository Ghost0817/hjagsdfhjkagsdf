Solar Flares
Solar flares often form around sunspots. A solar flare forms when gases and energy explode from the sun's surface. The jet of energy shoots into space. It reaches Earth in just a few days. Colliding with Earth's atmosphere, the energy streams toward Earth's poles. It causes gases in the atmosphere to glow, green, blue, red, and even pink. We call these shimmering colors auroras. Energy from the sun not only warms Earth. It warms all the planets. A planet is a large space object that orbits a star. In all, eight planets orbit the Sun (or nine, for those who count Pluto among them). Four of these planets are small, rocky worlds. They're called the inner planets. The other four are gas giants. They're called the outer planets. (And a dwarf planet, for those who count Pluto.)
