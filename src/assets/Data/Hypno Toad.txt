Hypno Toad
Tiny poison dart frogs may be only one inch long but they pack a powerful punch of poison. Weighing less than an ounce, these frogs are considered one of Earth's most toxic species. For example, the golden poison dart frog has enough poison to kill 20,000 mice. With a range of bright colors, yellows, oranges, reds, greens, and blues, they aren't just big show-offs, either. Those colorful designs tell potential predators, \"I'm toxic; don't eat me.\" Scientists believe that poison dart frogs get their toxicity from some of the insects they eat. The insects feed on plants that have toxins, which they then pass on to the frogs who fed on them. Poison dart frogs raised in captivity aren't toxic because the insects they are fed haven't eaten poisonous plants. How do poison dart frogs capture their prey? With a long, sticky tongue that darts out and zaps the unsuspecting bug! The frogs eat many kinds of small insects, including fruit flies, ants, and tiny beetles, which are the ones scientists think may be responsible for the frogs' toxicity. Poison dart frogs live in the rain forests of Central and South America and breed during the rainy season. To attract a female, the male frog calls from a leaf, making buzzing or trilling sounds. After he's attracted a mate and she lays her eggs, the male sticks around to make sure the eggs stay moist until they hatch. Once the little ones hatch as tiny tadpoles, they wiggle on to the male's back. He carries them to a pool of water where the tadpoles wiggle off and complete their metamorphosis into fully-formed frogs.
