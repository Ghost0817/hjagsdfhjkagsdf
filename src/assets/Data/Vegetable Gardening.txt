Vegetable Gardening
Vegetable gardening requires a lot more work than herb gardening. In fact, vegetable gardening can be one of the most time-consuming types of gardening. Many vegetables require watering and fertilizing at regular intervals, and may require a lot of different types of maintenance. Some vegetables are hardier and less picky than others. You can find some types of vegetables that don't require a lot of work at all so you can still find vegetable gardening a fun and relaxing hobby if you're careful to choose varieties that don't require constant attention. Some people may especially enjoy vegetable gardening because they love the satisfaction of growing some of their own food.
