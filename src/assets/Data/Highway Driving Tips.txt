Highway Driving Tips
When you're on the highway, use cruise control, which helps maintain a constant speed. Use the highest gear possible and overdrive gears if you have them. The faster an engine is turning, the more gas you're using. Pay attention to your tachometer. Plus, a slower turning engine means less friction and engine wear. Avoid excessive idling. Idling gets zero miles per gallon. It doesn't get much worse than that. If you're stopped for a train or backed up in a fast food take-out line or waiting for a drive-thru bank teller, stop your engine if you're going to be idling for more than 30 seconds.
