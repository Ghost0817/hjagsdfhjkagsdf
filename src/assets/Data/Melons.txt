Melons
Melons are sweet fruits. They have a fragrant, juicy inside that is usually eaten fresh. Melons are a good source of vitamins A and C. Common melons include cantaloupe, honeydew, and casaba. Melons are related to gourds, cucumbers, pumpkins, and squashes. Watermelons also are related, but they are not considered true melons. Melons originally grew in central Asia. Today, people grow them in warm areas throughout the world. Melon plants are annuals. This means they last only one growing season and must be replanted the following year.
