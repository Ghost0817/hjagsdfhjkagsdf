Volcanic Eruption
During a volcanic eruption, hot melted rock, called magma, escapes from a vent or opening on the Earth's surface or crust. Magma released from a volcano is known as lava. It glows red as it flows out of the volcano's opening. As it cools, it hardens into rock. Strong volcanic eruptions throw bits of magma into the air. These bits cool into tiny pieces of rock, called volcanic dust or volcanic ash. The wind can carry volcanic dust thousands of miles away. Volcanic ash can coat the land for miles around a volcano. Steam and poisonous gases also escape from volcanoes. Sometimes these gases are mixed with ash and other hot debris. This mixture travels outward in destructive fiery clouds, called pyroclastic flows.
