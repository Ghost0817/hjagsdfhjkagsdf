Gamma Rays
Gamma-ray bursts are flashes of gamma rays associated with extremely energetic explosions that have been observed in distant galaxies. They are the most luminous electromagnetic events known to occur in the universe. Bursts can last from ten milliseconds to several minutes, although a typical burst lasts between 20 to 40 seconds. The initial burst is usually followed by a longer-lived afterglow emitted at extended wavelengths. Most observed GRBs are believed to consist of a narrow beam of intense radiation released during a supernova event as a rapidly-rotating, high-mass star collapses to form a neutron star, quark star, or black hole.
