Longships
Longships were sea vessels made by Nordic Vikings and used for trade, commerce, exploration, and warfare during the Viking Age. The longship's design evolved over many years, beginning in the stone age with the invention of the Umiak and continuing up to the 9th century with the Nydam and Kvalsund ships. The longship appeared in its complete form between the 9th and 13th centuries. The character and appearance of these ships have been reflected in Scandinavian boat-building traditions until today. The longship is characterized as a graceful, long, narrow, light, wooden boat with a shallow draft hull designed for speed.
