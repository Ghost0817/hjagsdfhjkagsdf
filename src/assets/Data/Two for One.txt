Two for One
Don't be susceptible to the two-for-a-dollar marketing tool unless it's to your advantage with a coupon. If you need two of the item, go ahead and buy them; but save by buying only one if that's what you need. For example, the sign may read: 15 limes for a dollar. Unless you're a big lime user, some could go bad before you use them. There was a time when some shoppers felt using coupons was not appreciated by the grocer and hesitated to use them. They didn't want to hold up the line while the checker scanned coupons. It's a faster and easier method now with computers.
