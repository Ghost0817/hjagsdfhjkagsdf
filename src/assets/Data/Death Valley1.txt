Death Valley
Death Valley deserves its name. It is a sunburnt land of salt flats, bad water, and scorching sand. This parched place is the hottest, driest spot in North America. However, it has not always been a desert wasteland. It was once a lake. The climate was much wetter. The land nearby was rich with life. The valley was still a lake when the first Native Americans arrived about 10,000 years ago. About 1000 years ago, the ancestors of today's Timbisha Shoshone people came to the valley. Over time, the climate changed. Temperatures rose. Less rain fell. The lake dried up. Only a few freshwater springs remained in the foothills, mountains, and valley.
