Gardens
The type of garden you choose will depend on several factors. If you live in an apartment, it may be impossible for you to have a large vegetable garden no matter how much you may desire one. If you work 60 hours per week, caring for a very large rose garden could prove to be a little too much to handle. If you're confined to a wheelchair, taking care of a complex outdoor garden may be a bit beyond your capabilities. Ask yourself: how much space do I have available for gardening? How much time do I have to care for my plants? How physically capable am I to care for my garden?
