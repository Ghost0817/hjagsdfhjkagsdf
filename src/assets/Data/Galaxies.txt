Galaxies
A galaxy is a group of stars, clouds of gas, and dust particles that move together through the universe. There are billions of galaxies in the universe. They probably formed billions of years ago, soon after the universe began. The sun, Earth, and the other planets of the solar system are part of the Milky Way galaxy. Most galaxies move through the universe as part of clusters, or groups, of galaxies. The Milky Way is at one end of a cluster called the Local Group. It includes about forty galaxies. The largest galaxy in the Local Group is the Andromeda Galaxy. Galaxies are divided into three main categories based on their shapes: spiral, elliptical, and irregular.
