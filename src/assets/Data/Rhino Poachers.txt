Rhino Poachers
South Africa is home to most of the world's rhinos. However, the country has a big problem with poachers. Hunters killed more than twelve thousand of the country's rhinos last year and are killing them at a high rate this year to meet rising demand for their horns in parts of Asia. The buyers believe rhino horn, which is ground into powder, works as medicine. There is no scientific evidence to back up that idea. The horn is made of keratin, a protein also found in human fingernails. South Africa's national parks service rescued sixteen rhino orphans last year. A dozen were put in expert care. Four others were placed in government-run enclosures with female rhinos who act as mothers. The goal is to have the orphans return back to the rhino population in the wild.
