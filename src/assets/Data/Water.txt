Water
Water covers 70 percent of Earth's surface, yet most of it is unusable, which is why many people around the world struggle to get enough of it. Nearly 97 percent is salty or otherwise undrinkable. Another two percent is locked up in glaciers and ice caps. That leaves only one percent. People, plants, and animals depend on that one percent of fresh water. Each drop of water is always on the move. The water we drink is a liquid. It can also be a solid or a gas. No matter what state of matter it's in, all water is connected. It constantly moves through an endless cycle above, on, and through Earth. The amount of water on our planet never changes. There is the same amount now as there was when Earth formed.
