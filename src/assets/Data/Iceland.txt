Iceland
Hike through one of Iceland's many ancient lava fields. You might notice something strange. The ground in front of you is steaming. Plumes of white steam rise from the ground. Iceland is covered with steam vents and hot springs. The steam comes from naturally-heated rocks and hot water below Earth's surface. The most famous of Iceland's bubbling hot springs is Blue Lagoon. It is not far from the country's capital city. You can visit the lagoon and soak in its soothing, milky blue waters. Minerals and white mud in the water make your skin as soft as a newborn baby's skin. Icelanders tap into the natural hot water for more than soaking. They harness steam from hot water to spin turbines and create electricity. People use the electricity to heat homes and even greenhouses.
