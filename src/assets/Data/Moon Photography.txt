Moon Photography
Make the moon look extra cool by photographing it behind an object near the horizon. Buildings, statues, trees, and hills can all make great foreground subjects. You could also silhouette a person, animal, bicycle, or an airplane flying by. Of course, you'll need to find out what time and in which direction the moon will be rising so you can position yourself and your camera in a good spot. Check the weather forecast! If it's cloudy, you might still be able to capture a cool pic of the moon poking through the clouds. But if the weather's really bad, you could always go out the next night and still get some superb shots!
