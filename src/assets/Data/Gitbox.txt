Learning to play the guitar can be an extremely rewarding experience, but it is made even more so if you find the right teacher who will also guide to help you achieve your musical goals with the right resources. The best teachers always prepare and have a plan. In teaching, it is said that, for every hour of teaching, teachers need to prepare twice as much. You should be able to tell whether you're dealing with a professional in your first meeting. They will determine where you are, where you want to go, and then propose a method for getting you there. If you can tell that your prospective teacher hasn't prepared for the lesson and looks like they are making up stuff on the spot, they probably are. Get away as fast as you can.
