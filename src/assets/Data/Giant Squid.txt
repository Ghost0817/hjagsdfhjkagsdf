Giant Squid
Resembling huge, squishy darts with tentacles, giant squid live in the darkest depths of the ocean. People seldom see these mysterious creatures but scientists just got to know the animals much better. In a study published in March, researchers clear up a long-standing mystery about how closely these animals are related. They find the colossal creatures belong to a single global species. A species is a group of organisms that are similar enough to breed with each other. Until now, scientists had thought that giant squid belonged to three different species. One species lived in the North Atlantic Ocean, another in southern oceans, and a third in waters near Japan.
