Hubble Telescope
The Hubble Space Telescope is in orbit around Earth as a floating observatory. The Hubble magnifies and records images of distant space objects. It then sends the information to astronomers on Earth. Other spacecraft, both crewed and empty, have also gathered information about the Sun, Moon, and planets. In addition, astronomers use cameras and other instruments to record information about distant objects. Photographs provide astronomers with a visual record of their observations. Other instruments can help reveal faint, hard-to-detect objects in outer space. These instruments measure light and other radiation coming from these objects.
