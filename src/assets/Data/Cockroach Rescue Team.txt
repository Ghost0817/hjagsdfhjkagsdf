Cockroach Rescue Team
When buildings collapse in future disasters, a robotic cockroach may be the new hero helping rescue people. Disgusting as they may be, roaches have the remarkable ability to squish their bodies down to one quarter their normal size, yet still scamper at lightning speed. Also, they can withstand nine hundred times their body weight without being hurt. That's similar to a two hundred pound man who wouldn't be crushed by ninety tons on his head. The amazing cockroach-inspired scientists to create a mini robot that can mimic those feats of strength and agility. The researchers hope swarms of future roach-like robots could be fitted with cameras, microphones, and other sensors.
