Music to Tame Animals
Can music tame the wild beast? Can it hush puppies and calm kittens? A veterinarian thinks so. The vet has put music in over one thousand animal shelters and says it calms dogs and cats. Moreover, it even cuts down on barking. The vet started the nonprofit rescue animal project nearly four years ago. She asked artists around the world to donate dog-and-cat-friendly music. The result was an MP3 player packed with thirty hours of classics. The classics include music by Beethoven, Mozart, and Chopin. There were nursery rhymes like Three Blind Mice, as well as harps, pianos, and violins copying the sound of ocean waves and gentle breezes. These are given free to animal shelters. They are also given to sanctuaries and spay & neuter clinics.
