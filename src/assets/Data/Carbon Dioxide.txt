Carbon Dioxide
Carbon dioxide is a chemical compound that is usually in the form of a gas. It is made up of one atom of carbon and two atoms of oxygen. Carbon dioxide was discovered by a Belgian chemist named Jan Baptista van Helmont. Carbon dioxide is necessary for life on Earth. When animals breathe out, they release carbon dioxide into the air. Plants use this carbon dioxide to make their own food in a process called photosynthesis. Plants then release oxygen into the air for animals to breathe in. Carbon dioxide also is an essential part of Earth's atmosphere. It plays an important role as a greenhouse gas. A greenhouse gas traps energy from the Sun, which warms Earth's surface. This is known as the greenhouse effect.
