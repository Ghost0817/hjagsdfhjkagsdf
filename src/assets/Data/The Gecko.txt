The Gecko
What gives the gecko its grip? What allows it to stick to any surface, even glass? The answer is in its toes. A gecko's toes are wide and flat. Each toe pad is covered with thousands of tiny hairs called setae. Each hair splits apart into even smaller hairs at the tip. These tips can stick to surfaces. To get unstuck, a gecko peels its toes off of the surface, starting with the tip of its toe. A gecko's toe joints can bend in the opposite direction of our fingers and toes. All of this sticking and unsticking happens very fast. A gecko running up a wall might attach and detach its toes 30 times per second.
