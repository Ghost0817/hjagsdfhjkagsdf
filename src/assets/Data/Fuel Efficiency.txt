Fuel Efficiency
The faster you drive, the more fuel you're using. 55 mph is the optimum speed on the highway. Authorities are again considering making 55 mph required on all highways in an effort to mandate fuel conservation. If they do that, you'll be well ahead of the game. On some highways in West Texas, you can legally drive 80 mph. Gas mileage drops dramatically at this speed. Don't drive erratically. Strive for smooth starts and stops. Pick a lane and stay in it without weaving in and out of traffic. The shortest distance between two points is a straight line.
