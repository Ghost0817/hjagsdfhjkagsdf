Eating Insects
Today, insects are part of traditional diets throughout much of the world. You don't even have to go to remote places like a rain forest to find bugs on the menu. In Mexico, you can buy grasshoppers by the bag. Just roast and wrap in a tortilla. At the movies in South America, the snack bar might serve roasted ants instead of popcorn. If you wander through a market in Thailand, you'll find bins of deep-fried silkworms and water bugs. A handful makes a perfect snack. Even if you haven't been to these places, you may have eaten bugs, too. You may not have done it on purpose, though. Bug bits end up in such foods as chocolate and peanut butter. In the United States, an average person eats about a pound of insects a year.
