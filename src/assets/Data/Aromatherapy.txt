Aromatherapy
Lemongrass and sage scents, which are also good for fatigue, are known to help some people with headaches. These scents calm the nervous system and relax your inner being, which will minimize the headache that won't allow you to function. Can you believe aromatherapy can even help with your acne issues? Cedarwood, lemon, and sandalwood are effective scents that help promote the body's ability to control its hormonal balance as well as the skin's oil production. Aromatherapy is an excellent solution for those who are looking for alternative treatments to use in minor medical issues.
