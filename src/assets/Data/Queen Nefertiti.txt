Queen Nefertiti
The ancient Egyptian Queen Nefertiti has long been at the center of a mystery. For years, archaeologists have wondered where her tomb might be hidden. Nefertiti belonged to the family line of the famous King Tutankhamun, better known as King Tut. Indeed, some believe she was Tut's mother. While the other royals in her line are all accounted for, Nefertiti is still missing. Now, however, an archaeologist claims to have found her secret tomb. He says it is in the Valley of the Kings, hidden just beyond a wall near the resting place of Tut. His theory is based on a detailed study of the walls of Tutankhamun's tomb. Using radar scans, he was able to see what the walls looked like beneath their layers of paint.
