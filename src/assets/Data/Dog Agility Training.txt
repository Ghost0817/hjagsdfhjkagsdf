Dog Agility Training
Dogs often love attending a dog agility training class. They're given the opportunity to work in a new environment with ramps, jumps, poles, and tires that are often colorful and inviting. To be a part of a dog agility training class, most groups will require that you've previously attended and completed an obedience class for your dog and many will ban your pet from participation if it's an aggressive animal. Usually, a dog agility class will run for about an hour once a week, for a course of six weeks. Classes begin with warm-ups and playtime to get the dog acclimated to its surroundings.
