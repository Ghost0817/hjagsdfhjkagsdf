Elkhorn Coral
The oceans are changing. You can't tell by standing on a beach and watching waves roll in. But ocean water is becoming more acidic, experiments now show. One vulnerable animal is the Elkhorn coral, which is found throughout the Caribbean Sea. Elkhorn coral used to be easy to find in shallow water. Now it's an endangered species. In the last thirty years, many populations of Elkhorn coral have collapsed. Disease outbreaks, hurricanes, and elevated temperatures may all have played a role. Scientists are working on ways to save the coral, but they still have a long way to go. The coral may face yet another threat. In more acidic waters, Elkhorn coral is less successful at reproducing.
